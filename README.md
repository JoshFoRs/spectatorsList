Shows a spectator list so you can see who's watching. All players in game must have the mod in order for it to work.

/specColor #000000 in chat to change the color of the spectators names.
/specHeader #000000 in chat to change the color of the "Spectators:" text.

## Other Info

Uses chat filtering to pass the spectating messages back and forth, not really the most ideal way to go about it but it seemed like a funny way of doing it.
